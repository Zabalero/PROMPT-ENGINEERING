# Atlas: An Agentic Coding Framework
Created by Gemini-2.5-pro

Welcome to Atlas, a next-generation framework designed to empower AI agents as proactive, learning partners in the software development lifecycle.

Atlas synthesizes the best principles from leading agentic coding protocols to create a comprehensive ecosystem for AI-assisted development. It combines the rigorous safety of workflow-driven protocols with advanced capabilities for autonomous project management, deep contextual learning, and sophisticated cognitive reasoning.

## Core Philosophy

The goal of Atlas is to move beyond simple instruction-following. An Atlas-powered agent is designed to:

*   **Understand the Big Picture**: Maintain a deep, evolving understanding of the project's architecture, goals, and history.
*   **Manage Complexity**: Autonomously decompose large tasks into manageable steps, track progress, and manage its own workload.
*   **Learn and Adapt**: Continuously learn from interactions, decisions, and outcomes to improve its performance over time.
*   **Operate Safely**: Follow a structured, verifiable workflow that ensures all actions are planned, deliberate, and approved.

## Key Components

The Atlas framework is built upon several key pillars, each detailed in its own document:

*   **[Architecture](docs/architecture.md)**: A high-level overview of the system's components and their interactions.
*   **[Cognitive Model](docs/cognition.md)**: The guiding principles and reasoning modes that govern the agent's "thought process."
*   **[Operational Workflow](docs/workflow.md)**: The core RIPER-A (Research, Innovate, Plan, Execute, Review, Adapt) cycle that structures all agent activities.
*   **[The Nexus (Memory System)](docs/nexus.md)**: The persistent memory system that serves as the agent's long-term brain.
*   **[The Codex (Task Management)](docs/codex.md)**: The integrated system for managing tasks, sprints, and project backlogs.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Atlas framework, familiarize yourself with the core documents linked above. The framework is designed to be initialized within a project, creating a `.atlas/` directory to store all its operational files.
