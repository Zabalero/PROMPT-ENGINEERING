## Todo App (NANO)

### 🎯 Project Goal
Create a simple, interactive todo application for learning web development fundamentals.

### 📋 User Interaction
```
You: "I want to create a todo app but I'm new to web development"

NEXUS: [NANO MODE] Welcome! Perfect project for learning! 🎓

I'll guide you step-by-step through creating a todo app with:
- ✅ HTML structure
- 🎨 CSS styling  
- ⚡ JavaScript functionality

We'll start simple and I'll explain every concept. Ready to begin?

Let's start with the HTML structure...
```

### 📝 Workflow Execution
```
Phase 1: Understanding Requirements
NEXUS: Let's clarify what your todo app needs:
- Add new todos ✓
- Mark todos as complete ✓
- Delete todos ✓
- Simple, clean design ✓

Phase 2: HTML Structure
NEXUS: Here's the HTML foundation:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Todo App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>My Todo List</h1>
        <div class="input-section">
            <input type="text" id="todoInput" placeholder="Enter a new todo...">
            <button id="addBtn">Add Todo</button>
        </div>
        <ul id="todoList"></ul>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

💡 Explanation: This creates the basic structure with an input field, 
button, and list container. The container div helps with styling.
```
