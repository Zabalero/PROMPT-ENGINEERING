# Infinite Workflow Engine (Ω∞)

The Infinite Workflow Engine is NEXUS's revolutionary workflow system that goes beyond traditional fixed workflows to create dynamic, adaptive, and infinitely extensible process orchestration.

## Core Philosophy

```
Ω∞ = ∑(workflow_patterns) × adaptive_intelligence × contextual_optimization
```

The engine transcends traditional workflow limitations by:
- **Dynamic workflow creation** based on context
- **Intelligent workflow fusion** for complex scenarios
- **Real-time adaptation** to changing requirements
- **Cross-domain workflow synthesis** for novel problems

## Workflow Architecture

### Base Workflow Patterns
```yaml
core_workflows:
  RIPER: # Research → Innovate → Plan → Execute → Review
    phases: [Ω₁, Ω₂, Ω₃, Ω₄, Ω₅]
    use_case: "comprehensive_development"
    complexity: "high"
    
  RAPID: # Research → Plan → Execute
    phases: [Ω₁, Ω₃, Ω₄]
    use_case: "quick_implementations"
    complexity: "low"
    
  CREATIVE: # Innovate → Experiment → Evaluate → Refine
    phases: [Ω₂, Ω₆, Ω₇, Ω₈]
    use_case: "exploration_innovation"
    complexity: "variable"
    
  ANALYTICAL: # Research → Analyze → Model → Validate
    phases: [Ω₁, Ω₉, Ω₁₀, Ω₁₁]
    use_case: "data_science_research"
    complexity: "high"
    
  MAINTENANCE: # Analyze → Fix → Test → Deploy
    phases: [Ω₉, Ω₁₂, Ω₁₃, Ω₁₄]
    use_case: "bug_fixes_maintenance"
    complexity: "medium"
```

  Ω₁₄: # DEPLOY
    purpose: "deployment_release"
    inputs: ["tested_solution", "deployment_requirements"]
    outputs: ["deployed_system", "deployment_metrics"]
```

## Dynamic Workflow Creation

### Context-Driven Workflow Generation
```python
class WorkflowGenerator:
    def generate_workflow(self, context):
        """Generate optimal workflow based on context"""
        # Analyze context requirements
        requirements = self.analyze_requirements(context)
        
        # Select base workflow pattern
        base_pattern = self.select_base_pattern(requirements)
        
        # Customize phases based on specifics
        customized_phases = self.customize_phases(base_pattern, requirements)
        
        # Optimize phase sequence
        optimized_sequence = self.optimize_sequence(customized_phases)
        
        return Workflow(optimized_sequence, context)
        
    def analyze_requirements(self, context):
        """Extract workflow requirements from context"""
        return {
            'complexity': self.assess_complexity(context),
            'domain': self.identify_domain(context),
            'constraints': self.extract_constraints(context),
            'goals': self.identify_goals(context),
            'resources': self.assess_resources(context)
        }
```

### Workflow Fusion Engine
```python
class WorkflowFusion:
    def fuse_workflows(self, workflows, fusion_strategy):
        """Combine multiple workflows intelligently"""
        if fusion_strategy == "sequential":
            return self.sequential_fusion(workflows)
        elif fusion_strategy == "parallel":
            return self.parallel_fusion(workflows)
        elif fusion_strategy == "interleaved":
            return self.interleaved_fusion(workflows)
        elif fusion_strategy == "conditional":
            return self.conditional_fusion(workflows)
            
    def sequential_fusion(self, workflows):
        """Execute workflows in sequence with intelligent handoffs"""
        fused = FusedWorkflow()
        for workflow in workflows:
            fused.add_sequential_segment(workflow)
            fused.add_handoff_logic(workflow.outputs, next_workflow.inputs)
        return fused
        
    def parallel_fusion(self, workflows):
        """Execute workflows in parallel with synchronization points"""
        fused = FusedWorkflow()
        sync_points = self.identify_sync_points(workflows)
        fused.add_parallel_segments(workflows, sync_points)
        return fused
```

## Adaptive Workflow Execution

### Real-Time Adaptation
```python
class AdaptiveExecutor:
    def execute_with_adaptation(self, workflow, context):
        """Execute workflow with real-time adaptation"""
        execution_state = ExecutionState(workflow, context)
        
        for phase in workflow.phases:
            # Pre-phase adaptation
            adapted_phase = self.adapt_phase(phase, execution_state)
            
            # Execute phase
            result = self.execute_phase(adapted_phase, execution_state)
            
            # Post-phase learning and adaptation
            execution_state.update(result)
            self.learn_from_execution(phase, result, execution_state)
            
            # Decide next phase(s)
            next_phases = self.determine_next_phases(execution_state)
            workflow.update_upcoming_phases(next_phases)
            
        return execution_state.get_final_result()
        
    def adapt_phase(self, phase, execution_state):
        """Adapt phase based on current execution state"""
        # Analyze current state
        state_analysis = self.analyze_execution_state(execution_state)
        
        # Determine necessary adaptations
        adaptations = self.determine_adaptations(phase, state_analysis)
        
        # Apply adaptations
        return self.apply_adaptations(phase, adaptations)
```

### Intelligent Phase Transitions
```yaml
transition_logic:
  success_transitions:
    Ω₁_success: ["Ω₂", "Ω₃"]  # Research success → Innovate or Plan
    Ω₂_success: ["Ω₃", "Ω₆"]  # Innovation success → Plan or Experiment
    Ω₃_success: ["Ω₄"]        # Plan success → Execute
    
  failure_transitions:
    Ω₁_failure: ["Ω₁", "Ω₉"]  # Research failure → Re-research or Deep Analysis
    Ω₂_failure: ["Ω₁", "Ω₂"]  # Innovation failure → Research or Re-innovate
    Ω₄_failure: ["Ω₃", "Ω₉"]  # Execution failure → Re-plan or Analyze
    
  conditional_transitions:
    high_complexity: "add_phases(Ω₆, Ω₇)"  # Add Experiment + Evaluate
    time_constraints: "use_workflow(RAPID)"  # Switch to rapid workflow
    quality_requirements: "add_phases(Ω₁₁, Ω₁₃)"  # Add Validate + Test
```

        # Add quality gates
        quality_gated = self.add_quality_gates(reviewed)
        
        return quality_gated
```

### Resource-Aware Scheduling
```python
class ResourceScheduler:
    def schedule_workflow(self, workflow, available_resources):
        """Schedule workflow execution based on available resources"""
        resource_requirements = self.analyze_resource_requirements(workflow)
        
        if self.sufficient_resources(resource_requirements, available_resources):
            return self.optimal_schedule(workflow, available_resources)
        else:
            return self.resource_constrained_schedule(workflow, available_resources)
            
    def resource_constrained_schedule(self, workflow, limited_resources):
        """Create schedule when resources are limited"""
        # Prioritize critical phases
        prioritized = self.prioritize_phases(workflow)
        
        # Defer non-critical phases
        deferred = self.defer_optional_phases(prioritized)
        
        # Create checkpoint-based execution
        checkpointed = self.add_resource_checkpoints(deferred)
        
        return checkpointed
