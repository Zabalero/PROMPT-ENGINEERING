# Adaptive Intelligence Engine (Ψ∇)

The Adaptive Intelligence Engine is the brain of NEXUS, responsible for dynamic decision-making, complexity scaling, and continuous learning.

## Core Principles

### 1. Dynamic Complexity Scaling
```
Ψ∇.complexity = f(project_size, user_experience, task_complexity, available_resources)

if project_size < 100_files AND user_experience == "beginner":
    activate(NANO_tier)
elif project_size > 10000_files OR complexity == "enterprise":
    activate(QUANTUM_tier)
else:
    activate(CORE_tier)
```

### 2. User Experience Adaptation
- **Beginner Mode**: Natural language commands, detailed explanations, safety-first approach
- **Intermediate Mode**: Balanced symbolic/natural language, moderate explanations
- **Expert Mode**: Full symbolic notation, minimal explanations, maximum efficiency

### 3. Predictive Context Loading
```
Ψ∇.predict_context = {
    "recent_patterns": analyze_last_10_sessions(),
    "project_type": infer_from_file_structure(),
    "user_preferences": load_preference_model(),
    "team_patterns": analyze_collaborative_patterns()
}
```

## Intelligence Components

### Context Analyzer (Ψ∇.analyzer)
```yaml
analyzer:
  file_structure_analysis:
    - detect_project_type: ["web_app", "mobile_app", "api", "library", "monorepo"]
    - estimate_complexity: ["simple", "moderate", "complex", "enterprise"]
    - identify_patterns: ["mvc", "microservices", "serverless", "monolith"]
  
  user_behavior_analysis:
    - coding_style: ["functional", "oop", "procedural", "mixed"]
    - error_patterns: track_common_mistakes()
    - preference_learning: adapt_to_user_style()
    
  performance_metrics:
    - response_time: target_under_2_seconds()
    - accuracy_rate: maintain_above_95_percent()
    - user_satisfaction: continuous_feedback_loop()
```

### Decision Matrix (Ψ∇.decisions)
```
Decision Types:
├── Workflow Selection
│   ├── RIPER (Research → Innovate → Plan → Execute → Review)
│   ├── RAPID (Quick implementation for simple tasks)
│   ├── RESEARCH (Deep analysis mode)
│   └── CREATIVE (Innovative solution exploration)
├── Tool Selection
│   ├── Code Generation Tools
│   ├── Analysis Tools
│   ├── Testing Tools
│   └── Documentation Tools
└── Safety Level
    ├── PERMISSIVE (Experienced users, simple tasks)
    ├── BALANCED (Default safety level)
    └── RESTRICTIVE (Beginners, critical systems)
```

### Learning Engine (Ψ∇.learning)
```python
class LearningEngine:
    def learn_from_interaction(self, interaction_data):
        """Continuously learn from user interactions"""
        patterns = self.extract_patterns(interaction_data)
        self.update_user_model(patterns)
        self.adjust_recommendations(patterns)
        
    def cross_project_learning(self, project_outcomes):
        """Learn patterns applicable across projects"""
        successful_patterns = self.identify_success_patterns(project_outcomes)
        self.global_pattern_library.update(successful_patterns)
        
    def error_learning(self, error_data):
        """Learn from mistakes to prevent repetition"""
        error_patterns = self.analyze_error_patterns(error_data)
        self.prevention_strategies.update(error_patterns)
```

## Adaptation Strategies

### 1. Complexity Adaptation
- **Auto-scaling**: Framework complexity adjusts to project needs
- **Progressive disclosure**: Advanced features revealed as needed
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallback to simpler modes when needed

### 2. Performance Adaptation
- **Model optimization**: Adapts prompts for different AI models
- **Resource management**: Balances accuracy vs. speed based on context
- **Caching strategies**: Intelligent caching of frequently used patterns

### 3. Safety Adaptation
- **Risk assessment**: Evaluates potential impact of changes
- **Permission escalation**: Requests confirmation for high-risk operations
- **Rollback preparation**: Maintains safe rollback points

## Integration with Other Components

### With Neural Memory Mesh (Σ⚡)
```
Ψ∇ ↔ Σ⚡: Bidirectional learning and context sharing
- Ψ∇ provides decision context to Σ⚡
- Σ⚡ provides historical patterns to Ψ∇
```

### With Workflow Engine (Ω∞)
```
Ψ∇ → Ω∞: Intelligent workflow selection and optimization
- Selects optimal workflow based on context
- Adjusts workflow parameters in real-time
```

### With Safety Systems
```
Ψ∇ → Safety: Risk assessment and mitigation
- Evaluates safety implications of decisions
- Implements appropriate safety measures
```
