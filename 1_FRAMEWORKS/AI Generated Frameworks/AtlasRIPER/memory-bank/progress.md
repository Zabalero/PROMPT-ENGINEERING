# Progress Log (AtlasRIPER)

## Usage
Append entries chronologically. Each entry contains either a PlanCard or a ReviewCard (compressed), with links to artifacts, diffs, and commits.

## Entry 1 — PlanCard
- Date/Time:
- Mode: architect | orchestrator
- Task:
- Risk tier: L | M | H
- Branch:
- Steps (summary):
- Oracles:
- Links: templates/plan-card.md

## Entry 2 — ReviewCard
- Date/Time:
- Mode: code | debug
- Outcome: pass | partial | fail
- Summary:
- Tests (pre/post):
- Fault isolation notes (if failing):
- Next steps:
- Links: templates/review-card.md

## Notes
- Keep each entry ≤ 200 tokens; link to full diffs/logs instead of inlining.

> NOTE: Reference commit hashes and artifact paths for traceability.
