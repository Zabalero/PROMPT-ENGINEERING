# SPARC Framework Implementation Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for implementing the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) framework in your AI workflow system. It explains how the configuration files align with the core vision and requirements, ensuring a cohesive experience across all specialized modes.

## Core Vision Alignment

The SPARC framework implementation is built around these key principles:

1. **Specialized Agents**: Each mode is optimized for specific types of tasks
