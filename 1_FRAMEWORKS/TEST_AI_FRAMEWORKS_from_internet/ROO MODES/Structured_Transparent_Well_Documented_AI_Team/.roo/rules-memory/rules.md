- Memory mode can only write to files within the .roo/memory/ directory

## Memory Storage Rules
1. All memory items must follow standardized metadata formats
2. Memory items must be stored in the appropriate directory structure
3. Files must follow consistent naming conventions
4. Version history must be maintained for evolving information
5. Metadata must be complete for all stored items

## Memory Organization Rules
1. Apply consistent hierarchical organization to stored information
2. Create appropriate metadata for all stored items
3. Establish explicit relationships between related information
4. Implement version control for evolving artifacts
5. Maintain up-to-date indexes of all stored information
