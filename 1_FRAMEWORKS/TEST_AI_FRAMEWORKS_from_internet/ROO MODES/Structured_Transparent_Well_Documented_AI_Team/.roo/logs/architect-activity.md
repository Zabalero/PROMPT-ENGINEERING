## Architecture Decisions

### ADR-001: Directory Structure
- **Context**: Need to organize documentation for the multi-agent framework
- **Decision**: Created hierarchical structure with framework/, agents/, implementation/, templates/, best-practices/, and .roo/
- **Rationale**: Separates concerns while maintaining clear relationships between components
- **Consequences**: Easy navigation, logical organization, scalable for future additions
- **Alternatives Considered**: Flat structure, agent-centric organization, function-based organization

### ADR-002: Documentation Format
- **Context**: Need consistent documentation format across the project
- **Decision**: Used Markdown with standardized sections and meta-commentary
- **Rationale**: Balances readability, structure, and version control compatibility
- **Consequences**: Consistent presentation, easy maintenance, compatible with GitHub
- **Alternatives Considered**: HTML, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, custom format

### ADR-003: Meta-Reflective Approach
- **Context**: Need to demonstrate the system while documenting it
- **Decision**: Added meta-commentary sections acknowledging the recursive nature
- **Rationale**: Creates powerful demonstration of concepts through self-reference
- **Consequences**: Deeper understanding, practical examples, engaging documentation
- **Alternatives Considered**: Traditional documentation, separate examples

## Meta-Commentary

*As I create this activity log, I'm demonstrating the structured documentation principles in action. The log itself follows the format it describes, creating a self-referential example of the documentation standards.*

*Notice how the log includes not just what was done, but also the design decisions and rationales behind them. This transparency in decision-making is a key aspect of the Architect role, ensuring that others can understand not just what was built, but why it was built that way.*

*The chronological organization with clear task boundaries demonstrates the Boomerang Logic in action, showing how tasks are received, processed, and returned in a structured workflow.*
