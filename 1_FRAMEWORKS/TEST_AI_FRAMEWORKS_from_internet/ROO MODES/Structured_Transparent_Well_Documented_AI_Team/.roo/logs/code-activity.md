### Implemented Memory Mode
- **Task ID**: memory-mode-setup-001
- **Files**: 
  - agents/memory/memory-agent.md
  - .roo/memory/ (directory structure)
  - .roo/memory/README.md
  - .roo/memory/index/*.json
  - .roo/memory/projects/sample-project/**
- **Description**: Implemented the Memory Mode agent and created the directory structure for memory storage. This included defining the Memory Agent's role, creating the storage structure, implementing index files, and setting up a sample project to demonstrate the system's capabilities.
- **Related Task**: Multi-agent framework enhancement
- **Notes**: This implementation uses a folder-based approach as an interim solution until the SQL memory MCP is built. The system organizes memory into projects, knowledge, context, and index categories, with standardized formats for different types of information.

### Implemented SPARC Framework Configuration
- **Task ID**: update-001
- **Files**: 
  - .roo/config.json
  - .roomodes
  - .roo/boomerang-state.json
  - .roo/rules/*.md
  - implementation/sparc-implementation-guide.md
  - .roo/memory/projects/sparc-implementation/**
- **Description**: Created comprehensive configuration files for the SPARC framework, including mode definitions, boomerang logic configuration, documentation standards, and memory system setup. Implemented rules for each specialized mode and created an implementation guide.
- **Related Task**: Comprehensive AI Workflow System Implementation
- **Notes**: The implementation aligns all personal AI modes with the SPARC framework, standardizes the workflow model across all components, and ensures consistent system prompts. The configuration includes detailed settings for each specialized mode, with appropriate file access permissions, cognitive processes, and rules.

### Created Self-Reflection Analysis
- **Task ID**: update-001
- **Files**: 
  - .roo/memory/projects/sparc-implementation/artifacts/self-reflection-analysis.md
  - .roo/memory/index/artifacts-index.json
  - .roo/memory/projects/sparc-implementation/project-metadata.json
- **Description**: Created a comprehensive self-reflection analysis of the SPARC framework implementation, identifying strengths, areas for improvement, implementation trade-offs, and future enhancement opportunities. Updated the memory system to include the new artifact and project.
- **Related Task**: Comprehensive AI Workflow System Implementation
- **Notes**: The self-reflection analysis provides a critical evaluation of the current implementation, highlighting its strengths in mode specialization, memory system design, structured documentation, and token optimization, while identifying opportunities for improvement in testing, onboarding, feedback mechanisms, and external integration.
