# Architecture Decision Record: Memory Storage Approach

## Context
The Memory Mode requires a storage system to persist information across sessions and make it available to all agents. While a SQL database would provide robust querying capabilities, there's a need for an interim solution until the SQL memory MCP is built.

## Decision
Implement a folder-based memory storage system within the workspace directory structure. This approach will:

1. Organize memory into hierarchical categories (projects, knowledge, context, index)
2. Use JSON files for structured data and metadata
3. Use Markdown files for human-readable content
4. Maintain explicit relationships through reference IDs

## Rationale
- **Immediate Implementation**: Can be implemented without external dependencies
- **Filesystem Integration**: Works natively with the existing workspace
- **Readability**: Files can be directly viewed and edited if needed
- **Transition Path**: Can be migrated to SQL storage in the future
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing file manipulation tools

## Consequences
### Positive
- Simple to implement and understand
- No external dependencies required
- Human-readable and editable
- Works with existing file manipulation tools

### Negative
- Limited query capabilities compared to a database
- No built-in transaction support
- Potential performance limitations with large datasets
- Manual relationship management required

## Alternatives Considered
1. **SQLite Database**: Would provide better query capabilities but requires additional implementation effort
2. **Remote Database Service**: Would offer robust features but introduces external dependencies
3. **In-Memory Only**: Simplest approach but lacks persistence
