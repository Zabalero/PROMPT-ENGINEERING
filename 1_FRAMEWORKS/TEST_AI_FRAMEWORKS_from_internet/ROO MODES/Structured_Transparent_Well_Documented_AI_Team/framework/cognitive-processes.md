# Cognitive Process Library

*This document was created by Roo in Architect mode, demonstrating the specialized agent approach described in the guide.*

## Overview

The Cognitive Process Library is a collection of 50 reusable reasoning patterns that combine primitive cognitive operations into effective sequences for different types of tasks. This library enables agents to apply structured thinking approaches consistently across various scenarios.

## Primitive Cognitive Operations

At the foundation of the Cognitive Process Library are these primitive operations:

### Observe
Perceives input without distortion. The gateway to understanding (e.g., read data, ingest signal, get sensor reading).

### Define
Establishes the identity, boundaries, and core attributes of a concept, object, or observation.

### Distinguish
Identifies differences between inputs or classifies input against known categories. Separates signal from noise.

### Sequence
Places items (steps, events, ideas) in logical, causal, or temporal order.

### Compare
Evaluates items based on criteria to reveal contrast, hierarchy, or value, supporting decision-making.

### Infer
Generates conclusions, predictions, or generalizations from evidence/premises.

### Reflect
Performs meta-cognition: questions assumptions, checks understanding, identifies gaps, or audits a reasoning chain.

### Ask
Formulates a query to seek information from an external source to reduce uncertainty.

### Synthesize
Merges multiple pieces of information into a unified, coherent whole (summary, report, hypothesis, etc.).

### Decide
Commits to a path or selects an option based on prior comparison, inference, or reflection.

### Adapt
Modifies a plan, definition, sequence, or assumption based on new observations, reflections, or feedback.

## Cognitive Processes

These primitive operations combine into powerful cognitive processes for different reasoning tasks:

### Basic Processes

1. **Initial Curiosity**
   - Sequence: Observe
   - Use: When first encountering a new domain or problem
   - Example: "Let me examine what information is available here."

2. **Focused Questioning**
   - Sequence: Observe → Define
   - Use: When clarifying the boundaries of a problem
   - Example: "Based on what I'm seeing, the key issue appears to be X."

3. **Basic Reasoning**
   - Sequence: Define → Infer
   - Use: For straightforward logical deductions
   - Example: "Given these parameters, we can conclude that..."

4. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Sequence: Observe → Infer
   - Use: When identifying patterns in data
   - Example: "Looking at these results, I notice a trend suggesting..."

5. **Thoughtful Reflection**
   - Sequence: Reflect
   - Use: When evaluating the quality of reasoning
   - Example: "Let me step back and consider if my approach is sound."

### Intermediate Processes

6. **Reflective Questioning**
   - Sequence: Observe → Reflect → Define
   - Use: When refining problem definitions
   - Example: "After examining the data and considering alternative interpretations, I believe the core issue is..."

7. **Insight Discovery**
   - Sequence: Observe → Infer → Synthesize
   - Use: When generating new ideas from observations
   - Example: "Based on these patterns, I can formulate a new hypothesis that..."

8. **Complex Decision-Making**
   - Sequence: Define → Infer → Reflect → Synthesize
   - Use: When evaluating multiple options with significant consequences
   - Example: "After defining our criteria, analyzing the options, and reflecting on potential biases, I recommend..."

9. **Adaptive Learning**
   - Sequence: Observe → Infer → Reflect
   - Use: When updating mental models based on new information
   - Example: "This new data contradicts my earlier conclusion. Upon reflection, I need to revise my understanding..."

10. **Critical Review**
    - Sequence: Observe → Reflect → Synthesize
    - Use: When evaluating the quality of information or arguments
    - Example: "After examining this source and reflecting on its methodology, I can summarize its reliability as..."

### Advanced Processes

11. **Hypothesis Testing**
    - Sequence: Define → Observe → Infer → Reflect
    - Use: When systematically evaluating a theory
    - Example: "I'll define what we expect to see if the theory is true, gather relevant data, draw conclusions, and check for alternative explanations."

12. **Creative Ideation**
    - Sequence: Infer → Synthesize → Reflect
    - Use: When generating novel solutions
    - Example: "By extending these principles and combining them in new ways, I can propose an innovative approach..."

13. **Strategic Planning**
    - Sequence: Define → Infer → Synthesize
    - Use: When developing long-term approaches
    - Example: "After clarifying our objectives and analyzing potential pathways, I can outline a comprehensive strategy..."

14. **Problem-Solving**
    - Sequence: Observe → Define → Infer → Reflect → Synthesize
    - Use: When addressing complex challenges
    - Example: "I'll examine the situation, identify the core problem, analyze potential solutions, check my reasoning, and develop an integrated approach."

15. **Evidence Triangulation**
    - Sequence: Observe → Distinguish → Compare → Infer
    - Use: When verifying information from multiple sources
    - Example: "By gathering data from different perspectives, separating facts from opinions, comparing accounts, and drawing careful conclusions..."

### Specialized Processes

16. **Root Cause Analysis**
    - Sequence: Observe → Sequence → Infer → Reflect
    - Use: When diagnosing the origin of problems
    - Example: "By examining the symptoms, establishing the timeline of events, identifying causal relationships, and checking for confirmation bias..."

17. **Operational Optimization**
    - Sequence: Observe → Define → Compare → Adapt
    - Use: When improving efficiency of processes
    - Example: "After analyzing current workflows, defining success metrics, comparing alternatives, and implementing targeted changes..."

18. **Synthesizing Complexity**
    - Sequence: Observe → Distinguish → Sequence → Synthesize
    - Use: When making sense of complex systems
    - Example: "By gathering comprehensive data, identifying key components, mapping relationships, and creating an integrated model..."

19. **Ethical Evaluation**
    - Sequence: Define → Compare → Reflect → Decide
    - Use: When addressing moral dilemmas
    - Example: "After clarifying the values at stake, comparing different ethical frameworks, reflecting on implications, and making a principled choice..."

20. **Fact-Checking**
    - Sequence: Observe → Define → Distinguish → Compare
    - Use: When verifying claims
    - Example: "By examining the original statement, defining what would constitute truth, separating facts from interpretations, and comparing with reliable sources..."

## Applying the Cognitive Process Library

When using the Cognitive Process Library:

1. **Match the process to the task**: Select the cognitive process most appropriate for the specific challenge
2. **Follow the sequence**: Execute each primitive operation in the defined order
3. **Document your reasoning**: Make your thought process explicit
4. **Adapt as needed**: Modify processes for unique situations

## Meta-Commentary

*As I (Roo) document these cognitive processes, I'm actively using several of them. I'm applying "Synthesizing Complexity" to organize the library into a coherent structure, "Define → Synthesize" to explain each process clearly, and "Reflect" to ensure the documentation is useful and comprehensive. This recursive application demonstrates how these processes can be used in practice.*
