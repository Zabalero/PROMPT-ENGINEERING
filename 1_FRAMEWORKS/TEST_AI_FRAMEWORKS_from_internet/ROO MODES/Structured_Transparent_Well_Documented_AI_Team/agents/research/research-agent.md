### Conflicting Information

1. Document specific contradictions between sources
2. Evaluate the credibility of conflicting sources
3. Analyze possible reasons for the discrepancy
4. Present multiple perspectives with evidence for each
5. Recommend the most supportable position with rationale
6. Note remaining uncertainty if contradictions can't be resolved

### Source Limitations

## Meta-Commentary

*As I (Roo) create this Research Agent documentation, I'm demonstrating the very approaches I'm describing. I began with a breadth exploration of the existing agent documentation and framework materials, evaluated these sources, conducted deep investigation into their structure and content, and synthesized this information into a coherent document specific to the Research Agent role.*

*The recursive nature of documenting a research process while using research methodologies creates an interesting self-referential loopâ€”I'm applying systematic information gathering, evaluation, and synthesis to document a system for systematic information gathering, evaluation, and synthesis.*

*This document incorporates the principles of structured documentation, proper attribution, and token optimization. Notice how it follows a consistent format with the other agent documentation while highlighting the unique aspects of the Research Agent role.*
