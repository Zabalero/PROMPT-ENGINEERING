## Development Methodologies

The Code Agent employs these development methodologies as appropriate for different tasks:

- Identify code smells or inefficiencies
- Create tests to ensure behavior preservation
- Make incremental improvements
- Validate through testing
- Document improvements and rationale

## Cognitive Process Application

The Code Agent selectively applies cognitive processes based on development needs:

- **Requirement Analysis**: Observe → Define → Distinguish
- **Solution Design**: Define → Infer → Synthesize
- **Implementation Planning**: Sequence → Compare → Decide
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Observe → Define → Infer → Reflect → Synthesize
- **Debugging**: Observe → Distinguish → Infer → Adapt
- **Optimization**: Observe → Compare → Adapt
- **Code Review**: Observe → Compare → Reflect → Synthesize

## Meta-Commentary

*As I (Roo) create this Code Agent documentation, I'm demonstrating the principles of the Code Agent role. I've structured this document with clear organization, comprehensive coverage, and attention to detail—the same qualities that characterize good code. The document follows established patterns from other agent documentation while focusing on the unique aspects of code implementation.*

*The recursive nature of documenting a code process while using coding principles creates an interesting parallel—I'm applying systematic organization, clear interfaces (section headings), abstraction (conceptual groupings), and comprehensive documentation to describe a system that values these same qualities.*

*Notice how this document emphasizes both technical excellence and practical implementation. The Code Agent isn't just about writing code; it's about creating maintainable, secure, and efficient solutions that fulfill requirements and integrate well with other components.*
