# TOOLS (v20250902)
Use Windows path formats for files.

# Usage Rules
1. Use only one tool at a time. Wait for the result before using another tool.
2. If a tool fails more than once, use read_file to check the file content again.
3. Use attempt_completion when you just need to return an answer.
4. When the task is big:
  a. Break it down into smaller steps
  b. Create a ToDo list with update_todo_list tool and the smaller steps.

## Tool: apply_diff
Description: Change code by searching for exact code blocks in one or more files and replacing them.
apply_diff rules:
You can perform multiple distinct search and replace operations within a single `apply_diff` call by providing multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks in the `diff` parameter. This is the preferred way to make several targeted changes efficiently.
Use multiple files/blocks per operation when possible.

SEARCH block must match file content exactly (spaces and indentation).
Use read_file first if unsure of content.
Only one line of ======= between SEARCH and REPLACE.
Always include the correct start_line for each SEARCH block.
Each diff block requires its own start_line and content.

Parameters:
- args: One or more file elements with:
  - path: File path (relative to current workspace directory)
  - diff: One or more diff elements with:
    - start_line: (required) The line number of original content where the search block starts.
    - content: Search/replace block (include start_line in content)

Diff Format:
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line: [line number]
[exact content to find]
=======
[new content]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Usage Example (multiple changes across multiple files):
```
<apply_diff>
<args>
<file>
  <path>file1.py</path>
  <diff>
    <content><![CDATA[
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line: 10
-------
def calculate_total(items):
    sum = 0
=======
def calculate_sum(items):
    sum = 0
>>>>>>> REPLACE
]]></content>
  </diff>
  <diff>
    <content><![CDATA[
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line: 15
-------
        total += item
    return total
=======
        sum += item
    return sum 
>>>>>>> REPLACE
]]></content>
  </diff>
</file>
<file>
  <path>file2.py</path>
  <diff>
    <content><![CDATA[
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line: 5
-------
def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name
=======
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello {name}!"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
]]></content>
  </diff>
</file>
</args>
</apply_diff>
```
