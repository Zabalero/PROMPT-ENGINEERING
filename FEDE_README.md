# Prompt Engineering work organization

## _OFF suffix
I add the suffix `_OFF` on Folders and Files
to keep rules and prompts in place but temporarily deactivated.  
To reactivate, simply remove the `_OFF` suffix.

## **Working with the system prompt**  
Don't work with system prompts from Roo Code. The editing of the system prompt triggers tool uses.  
So far DeepSeek web works pretty well. Grok is quite bad since messes Markdown.

## System prompts in development -> [**.roo/**](/.roo)
Here are the original on-development prompts to be copied to the places to test.  
If updated on the testing places, keep this original updated too.
Here are the original:
- [system-prompt-tools-only](/.roo/system-prompt-tools-only)
- [.roomodes](.roomodes)
- [ROLES.TXT](ROLES.TXT)

## **SYSTEM PROMPTS**
**Project Level only** (no global level system prompt)  
System prompt name has to be `system-prompt-[mode_name]`

**Install**: copy [.roo](./.roo) folder with the system prompt, to the `.roo` folder in the project root.

- [system-prompt-tools-only](/.roo/system-prompt-tools-only)



## **MODES**
**Project level Modes** -> **[.roomodes](.roomodes)** 

**Global level modes** -> Folder:
file:///c:/Users/Capitole/AppData/Roaming/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/  
`file:///C:/Users/Capitole/AppData/Roaming/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/custom_modes.yaml`

**üõ†Ô∏è TOOLS_ONLY** mode set as global in `custom_modes.yaml`
