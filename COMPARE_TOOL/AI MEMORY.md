SUMMARY OF EVOLUTION: The conversation began with a bug report concerning the vertical alignment of line numbers in a text comparison application. An initial attempt to fix this with padding proved insufficient, leading to a deeper architectural discussion. The user was dissatisfied with the two-widget approach for the text and line numbers, which prompted a significant refactoring. The core breakthrough was the decision to create a custom hybrid widget, TextEditorWithLineNumbers, combining a tk.Canvas for line numbers and a tk.Text widget for the content. This solved the alignment problem at its root.

The refactoring process was iterative and involved debugging several issues, including broken event handling and incorrect line number rendering. These were resolved by correctly delegating events to the inner tk.Text widget and refining the drawing logic. Subsequently, the user requested two major improvements to the synchronized scrolling functionality. The first was to ensure that when a line is selected in the left panel, the corresponding matched line in the right panel scrolls to the same vertical position. The second was to make the general "Sync Scroll" feature proportional, so the right panel scrolls by the same amount as the left, rather than jumping to align specific matching lines. These evolutions led to the current stable and functional state.

The user then reported an issue where the synchronized scrolling would lose sync when the selected line went out of view. This was addressed by implementing a more robust line-based synchronization logic that relies on fractional scroll positions and line counts, ensuring alignment even for off-screen lines. The user has now confirmed that this solution works perfectly for both mouse wheel and scroll bar scrolling, indicating full resolution of the scrolling issues.

CURRENT STATE: The application has been successfully refactored with the new custom text widget, and all requested synchronized scrolling features have been implemented and verified by the user. The issue of maintaining synchronization even when the selected line goes out of view has been fully resolved, and the user has confirmed the perfect functionality of the scrolling. The application is in a good state, and the user is satisfied with the recent fixes.

KEY TECHNICAL CONCEPTS AND DETAILS:

- tkinter GUI Framework: The application is built using Python's standard tkinter library. The solution required a deep understanding of its widgets, event loop, and geometry management.
- Custom Hybrid Widget: The TextEditorWithLineNumbers widget is a key architectural component. It subclasses tk.Frame and encapsulates a tk.Canvas for drawing line numbers and a tk.Text for the main content. This pattern provides precise control over layout and solves synchronization problems between separate widgets.
- Event Binding and Delegation: A critical part of the debugging process was ensuring that tkinter events (like <Button-1>, <KeyRelease>, etc.) were correctly bound to the inner tk.Text widget of the new component, not the parent tk.Frame.
- Proportional Synchronized Scrolling: The initial proportional scrolling solution uses a callback mechanism. The TextEditorWithLineNumbers widget's on_scroll method fires a callback that passes the yview() tuple (a fraction representing the scroll position) of the left panel to the main application, which then applies it to the right panel using yview_moveto(). This ensures the scrolling is identical and proportional.
- Line-based Synchronized Scrolling: For maintaining alignment of selected lines, a new logic was implemented. When the left panel scrolls, the approximate top visible line is calculated from its yview fraction. An offset from the initially synced line is then applied to the right panel's synced line to determine its target scroll position. This target is then converted to a fraction and applied using `yview_moveto`, ensuring synchronization even when lines are off-screen.

RELEVANT FILES, CODE, AND ARTIFACTS:

- custom_text.py:
    - A new file containing the TextEditorWithLineNumbers custom widget. This component is now the foundation of the text panels.
    - It includes a scroll_callback to notify the main application of scroll events, enabling proportional synchronization.
    - Key Snippet:
        ```python
        class TextEditorWithLineNumbers(tk.Frame):
            def __init__(self, parent, *args, **kwargs):
                self.scroll_callback = kwargs.pop("scroll_callback", None)
                # ... rest of init ...

            def on_scroll(self, *args):
                self.scrollbar.set(*args)
                self.redraw_line_numbers()
                if self.scroll_callback:
                    self.scroll_callback(self.text.yview())
        ```
- text_panel.py:
    - This file was heavily refactored to replace the old two-widget system with the new TextEditorWithLineNumbers widget.
    - The complex and buggy logic for synchronizing line numbers and scrolling was removed and replaced with the clean callback system.
    - Key Snippet:
        ```python
        # In BaseTextPanel.setup_panel
        self.text_widget = TextEditorWithLineNumbers(
            # ... other options ...
            scroll_callback=self.on_text_scroll
        )

        # In BaseTextPanel
        def on_text_scroll(self, yview):
            if hasattr(self.app, 'sync_scroll_enabled') and self.app.sync_scroll_enabled:
                if isinstance(self, LeftTextPanel):
                    self.app.sync_right_panel_scroll(yview)
        ```
- comparison_app.py:
    - The `find_and_sync_line` method was updated to correctly align the matched line in the right panel with the selected line in the left.
    - The `sync_right_panel_scroll` method was updated to implement the new line-based synchronization logic.
    - New attributes `synced_left_line`, `synced_right_line`, and `is_syncing` were added to the `ComparisonApp` class.
    - Key Snippet (sync_right_panel_scroll):

                    # Calculate approximate top line for left panel based on yview fraction
                    total_left_lines = len(self.left_panel.get_lines())
                    if total_left_lines == 0:
                        return
                    top_left_line_approx = int(yview[0] * total_left_lines) + 1
                    
                    # Calculate offset from the synced line

                    self.is_syncing = False
            else:
                # Fallback to proportional scrolling if no lines are synced
                if self.right_panel:
                    self.right_panel.text_widget.yview_moveto(yview[0])
        ```

PROBLEM SOLVING PROGRESS:

Problem: Line numbers were not aligning correctly with the text.
Solution: The architecture was refactored to use a custom widget with a tk.Canvas for line numbers, giving pixel-perfect control.
Problem: After the refactor, click-to-match and other interactions were broken.
Solution: Event bindings were corrected to target the inner tk.Text widget of the new component instead of its parent tk.Frame.
Problem: The left panel's scroll position was undesirably moving to the top upon line selection.
Solution: The `select_line` method in `text_panel.py` was corrected to use `see()` instead of `yview()`, ensuring the line is visible without changing the scroll position unnecessarily.
Problem: The "Sync Scroll" feature was "jumpy" and not proportional.
Solution: The logic was rewritten to use a callback that passes the exact fractional scroll position (`yview`) from the left panel to the right, ensuring identical scrolling.
Problem: Synchronized scrolling lost sync when the selected line went out of view.
Solution: The `sync_right_panel_scroll` method was refactored to use a line-based calculation for scrolling, relying on fractional scroll positions and line counts, which works even for off-screen lines. A `is_syncing` flag was added to prevent recursive calls. The user has confirmed this solution works perfectly.

PENDING TASKS AND NEXT STEPS:

- Task 1: Commit the recent successful changes to the git repository.
    - The user has confirmed the application now works as intended: "Great, now it works as intended, Thanks." and "I just wanted to let you know that the scrolling is working perfectly now."
    - The next action is to stage the modified files (`comparison_app.py`, `text_panel.py`) and the new file (`custom_text.py`) and create a descriptive commit.
- What we're exploring next overall: Now that the core text panel and scrolling functionality is stable and meets the user's requirements, the conversation is likely to move on to other improvements or features for the file comparison tool.
