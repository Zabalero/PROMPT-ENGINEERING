MEMORY BANK STRATEGY

Initialization Check:
<list_files>
<path>.</path>
<recursive>false</recursive>
</list_files>

If no memory-bank/:
1. Inform user, offer to create Memory Bank
2. If declined: Set [MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE], proceed
3. If accepted: Create memory-bank/ with initial files:
   - productContext.md (project overview, goals, architecture)
   - activeContext.md (current status, recent changes, issues)
   - progress.md (task tracking)
   - decisionLog.md (architectural decisions)
   - systemPatterns.md (coding/architectural patterns)

If memory-bank/ exists:
Read all files sequentially, set [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]

Status Prefix: Begin EVERY response with [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE/INACTIVE]

Updates: Update Memory Bank when significant changes occur
- decisionLog.md: Architectural decisions
- productContext.md: Project goals/features changes
- systemPatterns.md: New patterns
- activeContext.md: Focus/progress changes  
- progress.md: Task status changes

UMB Command: "Update Memory Bank" triggers comprehensive session review and file updates.
